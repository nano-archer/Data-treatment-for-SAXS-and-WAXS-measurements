# Data-treatment-for-SAXS-and-WAXS-measurements

A simple data treatment of SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) and WAXS (Wide Angle X-ray Scattering) measurements for three material: PET, AgBeH and stretched PET. They are plottet and saved for each individual material and in the end a Gauss fit has been made for the sharp peaks in the two PET plots.
